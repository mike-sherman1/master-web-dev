### webdev TODO:

- portfolio is ok, maybe change it to a dark theme with nicer borders between entries
- rave life 2 home button links to master homepage, switch to rave-life2.html
- length converter doesn't output
- list maker is fine, except for design ;)
- currency converter and imgwall broken because php not compatible with github pages
- general refactoring / clean-up
- some youtube links are dead
